            <p>The act of management goes beyond ensuring performance and meeting KPIs. Great managers develop people.
              And coaching is that essential skill that will build trust, boost workplace positivity and help people

            <p class="challenges f_j_b t16 c_222">Even the world’s best athletes need a coach. Coaching accelerates
              performance and activate full potential. With the right counsel and support, everyone is capable of
              greatness. Krauthammer provides personalised one-on-on coaching to help your managers and leaders
              develop skills, build relationship, overcome challenges and achieve their goals.</p>
            <p class="challenges f_j_b t16 c_222">The International Coaching Federation (ICF) defines coaching as
              partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their
              personal and professional potential. Coaching focuses on setting goals, creating outcomes and managing
              personal change. There are different types of coaching specialities. Krauthammer focuses on executive
              coaching, leadership coaching, business coaching and team coaching.</p>

            <p class="challenges f_j_b t16 c_222">At Krauthammer, the ultimate aim of coaching is to ensure the
              “long-term self-sustenance” of the individual or team being coached. It is crucial to take into account
              the individual or team’s maturity. By maturity, we mean competence rather than age or hierarchical
              position. We have developed a three-phase coaching model.</p>
            <p class="challenges f_j_b t16 c_222">Krauthammer coaches possess the Professional Certified Coach (PCC)
              credential from the International Coaching Federation (ICF). When you engage a Krauthammer coach, you
              can be assured of the highest competence and ethical standards. Coaching services can be purchased in
              packages of 3 or 6 sessions; and conducted either face-to-face or virtually through an online meeting
              tool. There is an introductory free session to understand needs, set goals and assess chemistry before
              the actual coaching starts.</p>

            <p class="challenges f_j_b t16 c_222">Great managers develop your capabilities, not tell you what to do.
              This two-days training is specially designed to help your managers and leaders build up coach-like
              behaviours so that they can better accelerate the development and performance of those they lead.</p>

            <p class="challenges f_j_b t16 c_222">What if your managers were also great coaches? What will this
              impact the people they lead and the organisation’s culture and performance. In a recent study, 75% of
              the organisations surveyed recognised coaching as a necessary leadership competency yet only 5%
              claimed to have trained their managers in coaching behaviours. The Harvard Business Review in an
              article, identifies coaching as the single most important managerial competency that separates highly
              effective managers from average ones.</p>
